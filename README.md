# SubnauticaBaseBuilder
Online Subnautica Base Builder Tool

You're free to use this code in any project as long as I(Niels Visbeek) get credited for the creation of the tool somewhere on the page that the tool is shown on, aswell as a link to the official webpage of the tool(https://allgamemaps.com/tools/subnautica/base-builder/).

IF YOU WISH TO USE THIS TOOL IN A COMMERCIAL PROJECT, PLEASE SEND ME MESSAGE ON DISCORD(Niels#6270).

Please note: the Subnautica Models are not included in this repo since they are property of Unknown Worlds.
This tool is compatible to be used with objects from other games aswell, you will have to get those object models yourself, though.
The tool was built with the ThreeJS Library, and all models are loaded via an OBJ/MTL Loader, if you wish to use a different loader, please refer to the ThreeJS documentation on how to do so.

This tool is connected via the AllGameMaps.com database and fetches all the object paths and URLs from there, aswell as the resource cost data etc. This information will not be made publicly available.

Although, I can tell you that the objects array should look something like this:

Please, do not send me any messages on how to set up this tool on your own website/project, if you are not familiar with ThreeJS/basic Javascript/JQuery development then you shouldn't be attempting to use this.

Enjoy!
